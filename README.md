bookmarklet
===========
This is a bookmarklet that automatically adds Google Analytics tracking codes to URLs.

Replace the network_name and network_param with the social networks and Google Analytics tracking code you'd like to append.

Example:        network_name: "Facebook",
                network_param: "?utm_medium=facebook"

Replace show_slug, show_name, and show_param with a slug for your show, the show's actual name, and the Google Analytics tracking code you'd like to append.

Example:        show_slug: "thirteen-point-seven",
                show_name: "13.7",
                show_param: "&utm_source=thirteenseven&utm_campaign=artsculture"
                
Make sure you use hyphens in between words in the show_slug.

Thank you to @jeremybowers for cleaning up the code and making it so much more user-friendly. (He's /jeremybowers on github.)
